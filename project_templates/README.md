# To Use

The Analytic Templates project currently only contains a project
template for R. I would like to have templates for R, Python, Clojure,
etc. Any language, especially FOSS languages, used for data analysis
is welcome. Because they are important, project templates for SAS and
SPSS are welcome. If necessary, there could be a project template for
SPSS and PSPP although it seems easier to keep them together under the
title SPSS.

To use a project template, copy the folder you want to use and paste
it into your projects folder. I use the folder ~/Git for all
projects. Assuming you use ~/Git, instructions to start a new R
project are as follows:

1. Copy the 'r' folder into ~/Git.
2. Rename the 'r' folder to something more descriptive of your actual project.
2. Open the README.md file and edit it.
3. From a terminal, git init.
4. If you are using GitHub, you will need to complete your Git config
   following their project-specific instructions.
5. Happy Hacking.
