# Project Description

A collection of folders and templates intended to provide structure
and rapid prototyping for analytic projects using languages such as
Python, R, SAS, SPSS, etc.

This is probably the third or fourth time I have dropped everything
from GitHub and started over. Hopefully this is the last time I
restart this thing.

As of today (2014-05-11), this project is far from complete. R and SQL
are my primary development platforms, thus most of the templates
target these two languages. But, I would like to include templates for
ANY language used for analysis. I will try to add a similar SAS
project template by the end of the summer as I become more familiar
with this widely used albeit restrictive language.


# Organization

The Analytic Templates project is divided up into six parts.

- config
- file_templates
- project_templates
- snippets
- style_guides

Over time, each of these folders will become populated with language
specific folders such as R, Python, SQL, etc.

## Config

Documents best practices for system configuration. This includes
Emacs / Vim integration, Git, etc. 

## file_tempaltes

Collection of language-specific templates. Most of these will assume
you are using the corresponding project template.

## project_templates

A collection of language-specific analytic project templates. The goal
of a project-template is to provide a common setup to make a complex
analysis projects easier to start and more systematic in
approach. Data sets should always be stored in the folder called
data. SQL files should always go into the sql folder, etc. Each
separate analysis should share a common structure for documentation,
boilerplate, etc. Rather than reproduce all of this work for each new
project, a project template provides the user with a pre-configured
work directory.

## snippets

Collection of useful, documented code snippets that demonstrate how to
do a specific task.

## style_guides

Collection of language-specific style guides.
