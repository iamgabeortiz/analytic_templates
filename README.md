# Project Description

A collection of folders and templates intended to provide structure
and rapid prototyping for analytic projects using languages such as
Python, R, SAS, SPSS, etc.

This is probably the third or fourth time I have dropped everything
from GitHub and started over. Hopefully this is the last time I
restart this thing.

As of today (2014-05-07), this is in rough shape, but I'm going to go
ahead and start inviting people to help me with it. Crowdsourcing FTW!


# Organization

The Analytic Templates project is divided up into six parts.

- config
- file_templates
- project_templates
- snippets
- style_guides

Over time, each of these folders will become populated with language
specific folders such as R, Python, SQL, etc.
